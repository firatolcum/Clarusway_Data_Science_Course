  - Linear Regression
  - Bias Variance Trade-off (Overfitting / Underfitting)
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Regularization
    - L1 Regularization (Lasso)
    - L2 Regularization (Ridge)
    - L1 and L2 Combined (Elastic Net)
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)
  - Support Vector Machines(SVM)
