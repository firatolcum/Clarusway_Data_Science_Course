## ðŸ“£ About this Machine Learning Course
A growing number of companies are developing machine learning products, increasing the demand for engineers who can deploy machine learning models to a global audience. Clarusway Machine Learning Course is designed to help you gain the advanced skills you need to become a machine learning engineer. 

In Machine Learning training, you will evaluate and update machine learning models into a production environment such as a web application by using performance metrics.

Machine Learning Course is a **13-week program that includes more than 135+ hours of in-class sessions and a bonus package of 54+ hours of Career Management Services (CMS)**. Our specialty CMS activities for the Machine Learning program include sessions on life coaching, resume building, Linkedin training, and interview preparation support.

In addition to the curriculum, you will have the opportunity to practice what youâ€™ve learned with hands-on activities **+ 10 projects + 3 Capstone Projects** at the end of the course.
